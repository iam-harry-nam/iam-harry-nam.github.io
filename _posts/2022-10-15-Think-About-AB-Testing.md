A/B Test is an essential experimental element for platform companies and is an essential proof work for rapid growth.
You can learn more about A/B Test by looking at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing

I was shocked to hear from a person from a famous IT company in Korea that there was no A/B test and that it was just applied when developing a feature.
Users may feel uncomfortable, but it's just distribution. I believe that developers and product owners who create new businesses all work hard to create features.
I think there is a tendency to think that what they have made is good. I think it is a bad decision to make a decision on whether to distribute a feature internally without a company verifying any data based on this preconceived notion.

So I think that creating an A/B Test platform is the number one priority over any other business development. If you look at many high-growth IT companies in Silicon Valley, you can see that they all use A/B Test to quickly verify and distribute various experiments. When I heard this, some Korean IT companies were already big, but I thought that startups could catch up.
