I am using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, and I feel comfortable using it once. I was able to use it for lucky chance for more than two years, and now I can not use on another editor.

**The difference between the IDEA Ultimate version and the Community version (free)** on the IntelliJ homepage is as follows.

<a href="/resource/image/intellij_1.png"><img src="/resource/image/intellij_1.png" width="700px" title="IntelliJ Languages Support" /></a>

<a href="/resource/image/intellij_2.png"><img src="/resource/image/intellij_2.png" width="700px" title="IntelliJ Framework Support" /></a>

<a href="/resource/image/intellij_3.png"><img src="/resource/image/intellij_3.png" width="700px" title="Version Control and Deployment functions" /></a>


Language support could be complemented by other tools from Jetbrains, such as Pycharm, WebStorm. But **Framework support is powerful** and I felt it was hard to overcome with other tools.

So I decided to buy Ultimate version and looking for price.

<a href="/resource/image/intellij_4.png"><img src="/resource/image/intellij_4.png" width="500px" title="IntelliJ 1-year price" /></a>

Even if you purchase only IntelliJ for the first purchase, the subscription fee for one year is about 500 dollar.

I did research to see if there was a cheaper development tool, and found that **Ultimate can be used free of charge for trained students or instructors.**

So I got a **student verification and a free one year subscription.** The verification is simple.

1\. go to this jetbrains link :Â [JetBrain Student register Hompage][JetBrain Student register Hompage]

2\. **Authenticate with your college email address.** Clicking the link in the email content will authenticate you. (If you do not see it in your inbox, check Spam.)

3\. Click on the link will connect to the **JetBrains Account Aggreement** content and read and agree.

4\. Now, when you use IntelliJ Ultimate version, you can use JetBrains account (authenticated as student or instructor) for free.

This is the way to use the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate for free.
